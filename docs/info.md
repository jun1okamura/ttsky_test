## How it works

This design uses a set of registers to divide the clock and combinational logic to convert binary values into decimal for display.

- Inputs[0]: Selects between a fixed period or a pseudo-random period for counting up the seven-segment display.
- Inputs[1]: Chooses between displaying either a hexadecimal sequence (“0” to “F”) or the text ”-OPENSUSI-AISol-” on the display.
- Bidirectional Outputs: The bottom 8 bits of a 24-bit counter are placed on the bidirectional outputs.

Fixed Period Mode:
- The internal 16-bit compare register is set to 10,000.
- This results in the display incrementing by one each second in case the CLK input is 10KHz.

Pseudo-Random Period Mode:
- If Input[0] is set to 1, an 8-bit pseudo-random value is used as bits 6 to 12 of the 16-bit compare register, introducing variation in the counting period.

## How to test

After reset, the counter will increment by one every second, assuming a 10MHz input clock.

You can experiment by modifying Inputs[1:0] to:
- Change the display characters
- Adjust the pseudo-random sequence of periodic speed

## External hardware

Only TT-EVB.

## Note

This is the first test project designed by “jun1okamura”, supported by OpenSUSI (non-profit) and AIST Solutions inc. in Japan.
